Office : 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro City, Tokyo 
		
I am a JSPS postdoctoral fellow at [Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), The University of Tokyo.
		
I am primarily interested in arithmetic geometry, in particular, p-adic Hodge theory and p-adic cohomology theories.

Previously, I was a postdoc in [Lille](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/).
Before that, I was a doctoral student at [Institut de Math&eacutematiques de Bordeaux](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/imb/spip.php) under the supervision of [Denis Benois](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~dbenoua/) and [Nicola Mazzari](https://sites.google.com/site/nclmzzr/).
Before joining the doctoral program, I was an [ALGANT](http://algant.eu/) master student in [Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics) and [Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/).
Even before that, I was a [software engineer](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b).

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

  return true;
}
```

```ruby

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
